# Testing Flux 11 vs. 12 on example 1 from AtomicGraphNets.jl

For more details about this example, go read [this readme](https://github.com/aced-differentiate/AtomicGraphNets.jl/tree/master/examples/1_formation_energy).

I've included a small amount of input data here as well as the outputs from running the scripts on 20,000 input points. Note that I haven't filtered the CSV to only contain the grpahs I copied, so if you want to actually run it you'll have to either do that or add a check...or download the Materials Project data yourself as described in the original example.
